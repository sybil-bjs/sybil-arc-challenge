prior_belief: "ACTION2 is a toggle or minor effect"
actual_behavior: "ACTION2 is DOWN movement (~6 pixels), same as UP is ~6 pixels"
lesson: "All 4 actions are directional movement: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Pixel-diff magnitude doesn't distinguish toggles from movement — need to track DIRECTION of change."

prior_belief: "Simple pathfinding: go to L-shape coordinates = win"
actual_behavior: "Player can pass through L-shape's Y coordinate (Y=32) without triggering win. Reached Y=26 from Y=46, passing Y=32."
lesson: "Win condition is NOT simple coordinate overlap. May require: exact pixel alignment, specific approach direction, or shape matching."

prior_belief: "Movement is uniform in all directions"
actual_behavior: "UP/DOWN move ~6 pixels per action. LEFT/RIGHT move ~5 pixels per action. Movement is blocked by yellow(4) walls."
lesson: "Different axes may have different movement speeds. Map walls carefully before planning paths."

prior_belief: "The brown block (color 9) is attached to the player"
actual_behavior: "Brown spans Y=11-60, X=3-43 — it's terrain/boundary, not a movable piece"
lesson: "Don't assume all colored elements are game pieces. Some are static terrain."
