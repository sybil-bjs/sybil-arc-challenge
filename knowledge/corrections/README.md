# ARC-AGI-3 Corrections

Track when my understanding of game mechanics was wrong.

## Format

```yaml
id: ARC3-COR-XXX
game: ls20
timestamp: 2026-02-27
prior_belief: "What I thought was true"
actual_behavior: "What actually happens"
lesson: "What to remember for next time"
stakes: low|medium|high
```

## Example

```yaml
id: ARC3-COR-001
game: ls20
timestamp: 2026-02-25
prior_belief: "The L-shape (colors 0,1) is what I control with actions"
actual_behavior: "The color12 block is what actions control. The L-shape is stationary."
lesson: "Don't assume the most visually prominent element is the player. Test each action and observe what ACTUALLY moves."
stakes: high
```
