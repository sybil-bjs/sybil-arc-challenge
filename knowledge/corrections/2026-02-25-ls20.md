# ARC-3 Corrections — ls20

id: ARC3-COR-001
game: ls20
timestamp: 2026-02-25
prior_belief: "The L-shape (colors 0,1) is the player element I control"
actual_behavior: "The color12 block (5x2) is what actions control. The L-shape is stationary and may be the TARGET."
lesson: "Don't assume the most visually prominent element is the player. Test each action individually and observe what ACTUALLY changes."

prior_belief: "ACTION2 moves the player DOWN (opposite of ACTION1/UP)"
actual_behavior: "ACTION2 only changes 2 pixels — may be a toggle, rotation, or interaction rather than movement"
lesson: "Actions aren't always directional. Some may be mode switches, interactions, or special abilities. Test carefully."

prior_belief: "Moving to the L-shape area will trigger level completion"
actual_behavior: "Unknown — haven't reached the L-shape yet. 50+ actions of movement didn't complete level 1."
lesson: "Win conditions in ARC-3 games are not obvious. May involve: matching shapes, reaching coordinates, collecting items, or triggering sequences."
