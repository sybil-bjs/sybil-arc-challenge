      - Yellow bar (move budget) increases

human_intuition: |
  "When I try completing without extra life, I realize I don't 
  have enough. So there MUST be another resource given to me."
  — Bridget
  
  Color matching: Yellow boxes → yellow life bar = related.
  Game design logic: Puzzle must be solvable → resources exist.

strategy_implications:
  - Collect pickups BEFORE running out of moves
  - Plan route to include pickups on the way
  - If path seems impossible, look for pickups
  - Color coding helps identify which resource they restore
