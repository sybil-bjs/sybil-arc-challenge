name: transformation_point
description: |
  An element that changes the player's state when interacted with.
  Usually transforms shape, color, or both to match a goal pattern.

first_seen: ls20
confidence: high
documented_by: [bridget, saber]

detection:
  visual:
    - type: rare_color_cluster
      threshold: "< 1% of pixels"
    - type: small_size
      cells: "2-10"
    - type: distinct_shape
      examples: [cross, plus_sign, circle]
    - type: high_contrast
      note: "Often white or bright against dark background"
  
  behavioral:
    - condition: disappears_on_touch
      note: "Single-use variant"
    - condition: causes_state_indicator_change
      required: true
    - condition: does_not_move
      note: "Static position"

interaction:
  trigger: overlap  # Player moves onto it
  effect: state_transformation
  consumable: true  # In ls20, plus sign is single-use
  multi_use_variant: false  # Some games may have respawning version

examples:
  - game: ls20
    appearance: "White cross/plus sign"
    pixel_value: 1
    cell_count: 2
    behavior: |
      - Player touches plus sign
      - Plus sign disappears (consumed)
      - State indicator in HUD changes
      - May need multiple plus signs for full transformation

human_intuition: |
  "As a human, I realized that plus signs usually mean 
  you're going to do something." — Bridget
  
  Plus signs are universal UI elements for "action" or "add".
  This transfers from real-world knowledge.

strategy_implications:
  - Must visit transformation point BEFORE goal (usually)
  - Check if state already matches goal (skip if yes)
  - Plan path: start → transform → goal
  - Don't backtrack over consumed transformation points
