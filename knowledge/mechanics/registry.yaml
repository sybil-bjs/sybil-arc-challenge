# Future mechanics to watch for:
# - gravity (falling elements)
# - push_pull (sokoban-style)
# - color_cycling (rainbow transformations)
# - teleporters (instant transport)
# - keys_and_doors (unlock mechanics)
# - multi_character (control switching)
# - enemies (avoid or defeat)
# - timers (real-time pressure)
