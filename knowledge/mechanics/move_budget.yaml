name: move_budget
description: |
  A limited resource that decreases with each action.
  Run out = failure. Creates urgency and requires efficient pathing.

first_seen: ls20
confidence: high
documented_by: [bridget, saber]

detection:
  visual:
    - type: horizontal_bar
      location: "Usually bottom of screen"
      note: "Classic video game life/energy bar"
    - type: color_gradient
      note: "Often yellow (safe) to red (danger)"
    - type: dynamic_length
      note: "Shrinks with each action"
  
  behavioral:
    - condition: decreases_on_action
      required: true
    - condition: level_fails_when_empty
      required: true
    - condition: can_be_refilled
      via: resource_pickup

interaction:
  trigger: passive (every action costs)
  effect: resource_consumption
  refill: resource_pickup items

examples:
  - game: ls20
    appearance: "Yellow bar with red section at end"
    location: "Bottom of screen"
    behavior: |
      - Each move decreases bar length
      - Yellow = safe, red = danger zone
      - When depleted = level fails
      - Yellow pickups restore budget

human_intuition: |
  "This little yellow bar with the little red things looks 
  to me a lot like a video game bar, the amount of life 
  I have left." — Bridget
  
  Universal UI pattern: horizontal bar = resource level.
  Color coding: yellow/green = good, red = bad.

strategy_implications:
  - Count available moves before planning
  - If path needs more moves than budget → find pickups
  - Optimize for shortest path, not exploration
  - Don't backtrack unnecessarily
  - "Budget moves, don't explore wastefully"
